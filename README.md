# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-and-Forecasting


Bitcoin is one of the oldest and biggest cryptocurrencies being traded as of now, in terms of the volume being traded. It is a digital asset over which central banks or any financial Institutions have no control or regulations. Bitcoin has a market share of more than 55% as compared to other cryptocurrencies. Here, we intend to study the prediction of Bitcoin prices using Machine Learning Techniques and prepare a strategy to maximize gains for investors. 
The results of this project will help the investors to know the changes in the prices of bitcoin beforehand when investing in any cryptocurrency and helps reduce the chances of facing a loss in any business environment. The datasets are available in the [twitter-senti.csv](https://github.com/kiran-lenka/Bitcoin-Price-Predictor/blob/main/twitter-senti.csv) and [reddit-senti.csv](https://github.com/kiran-lenka/Bitcoin-Price-Predictor/blob/main/reddit-senti.csv) files.
